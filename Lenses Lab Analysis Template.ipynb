    "Use this template as a starting point to carry out the analysis tasks.  For reference, here are links to recommended Python resources: the [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) and the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) both by Jake VanderPlas.\n",

    "## Standard Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good idea at the beginning of your notebook to include the packages that you will need.  We will use those shown below here.  A brief description:\n",
    "* `numpy` is the foundational package for Python numerical work. It extends and speeds up array operations beyond standard Python, and it includes almost all math functions that you would need for example `sqrt()` (square root) or `cos()` (cosine).  These would be written in code as `np.sqrt()` or `np.cos()`.\n",
    "* `scipy` is a huge collection of scientific data analysis functions, routines, physicical constants, etc.  This is the second most used package for scientific work. Here we will use the physical constants library, `scipy.constants`.  Documentation is at [SciPy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) with the constants subpackage at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html.\n",
    "* `uncertainties` is a very useful small package that simplifies uncertainty propagation and printing out of quantities with uncertainty. Documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is *the* standard plotting package for scientific Python.  We will use a subset called `pyplot` which is modeled after the plotting functions used in MATLAB. The last line below, `%matplotlib inline`, simply forces the plots to appear within the notebook.\n",
    "* `pandas` is a large data science package.  It's main feature is a set of methods to create and manipulate a \"DataFrame,\" which is an enlargement of the idea of an array.  I plays well with NumPy and other packages.  We will use it mainly as a way to read files into data sets in an easy way.\n",
    "* [LMFit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) is excellent for carrying out line and curve fits with many useful features."

    "4. **Read an Excel file with `pd.read_excel()`.** The Pandas library has some very powerful and easy to use function that can swallow a whole multi-worksheet Excel file in one call.  It makes a Python \"dictionary\" (type is `dict`) of Pandas DataFrames, with each DataFrame being one Excel sheet.\n",
